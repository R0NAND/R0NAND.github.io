                Hi! I'm a mechanical engineer from the University of Waterloo who mostly works as a 
                software developer these days. I initially got into programming through my passion 
                for physics simulations, and since then have built up professional work experience in 
                the fields of robotics and data engineering. This page serves as a 
                showcase for some of my additional personal projects.

                I've spent the last few months on the road; visiting many of the national parks and cities 
                across the USA. I took lots of pictures along the way, and realized I could use the 
                metadata from most of the resulting JPEGs to create an interactive travel map. It's still
                a bit of a work in progress, but you can play around with it for yourself

              During the summer of 2020; I found myself stuck inside with lots of free time, so naturally used it 
              to build a rigid body physics engine in javascript (I know....). It's not the most stable or performant
              engine on the market, but it served as a great learning experience in building complex modular software.
              You can play around with it for yourself at this the angry birds inspired demonstration I've set up 
              <a href="simulations/physics_engine/angry_birds.html">here.</a>

              Fluid dynamics was one of the reasons I chose to study mechanical engineering, and during my 
              undergrad, I decided to take my learning beyond the classroom by simulating their behaviour in 
              C++. One <a href="https://github.com/R0NAND/euler_fluid_simulation">method</a> 
              relied on representing the fluid as a velocity field that interacts with 
              itself over time to create the familiar swirls we see when mixing two fluids
              together. The other method used a technique called <a href="https://github.com/R0NAND/particle_hydrodynamics">
              Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics</a> where thousands of particles were finely tuned to interact with 
              each other in such a way that their collective behaviour would adequately 
              emulate the motion of an everyday fluid.

              <p>Programming Robot behaviour and algorithms is a lot of fun, but unfortunately, the cost and risks 
                associated with them can be a limitation. That's why I thought I'd try simulating them! Using ROS and 
                the Gazebo physics engine, I've been able to set up a few different machines in a virtual environment 
                for further programming and experimentation.

          <p>During my undergrad, I'd spent some time tinkering with electronics on the side to complement
            my studies. I've included some videos of these projects below. They were all built using an Arduino
            and various other basic electronic components.
